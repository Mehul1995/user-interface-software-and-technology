		<h1>Translating research into practice</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>
    
		<p>
			I love doing research on interfaces.
			There's nothing like imagining an entirely new way of interacting with a computer, creating it, and then showing it to the world.
			But if the inventions researchers like myself create never impact the interfaces we all use every day, what's the point?
			The answer, of course, is more complex than just a binary notion of an invention's impact.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, much of what you've read about in this book has <em>already</em> impacted other researchers.
			This type of research impact is critical: it shapes what other inventors think is possible, provides them with new ideas to pursue, and can sometimes catalyze entirely new genres.
			Think back, for example, to Vannevar Bush's Memex.
			No one actually made a Memex as described, nor did they need to; instead, other inventors selected some of their favorite ideas from his vision, combined them with other ideas, and manifested them in entirely unexpected ways.
			The result was more than just more research ideas, but eventually products and entire networks of computers that have begun to reshape society.
		</p>

		<p>
			How then, do research ideas <em>indirectly</em> lead to impact?
			I would argue, based on both experience, and historical records of interface innovation, that there are three essential events that musst occur.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Researchers must demonstrate feasibility</strong>.
				Until we know that something works, that it works well, and that it works consistently, it just doesn't matter how exciting the idea is.
				It took Xerox PARC years to make the GUI feel like something that could be a viable product.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Someone must take an entreprenurial risk</strong>.
				It doesn't matter how much evidence researchers gather about the viability of an interface idea.
				At some point, someone in an organization is going to have to see some opportunity in bringing that interface to the world at scale.
				Even if the interface is fully proven (which it never is), scale is its own risk.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>The interface has to win in the market</strong>.
				Even if an organization perfectly executes an interface at scale, and is fully committed to seeing it in the world, it only lives on if the timing is right for people to want it relative to other interfaces.
				Consider Google's many poorly timed innnovations: Google Glass, Google Wave, Google Buzz, Google Video; all of these were compelling new interface innovations, but none of them found a market.       
		</ul>
