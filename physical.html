		<h1>Physical Output</h1>

		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>
		
		<p>Whereas the three-dimensional output we discussed in <a href="3D.html">the previous chapter</a> can create entirely new virtual worlds, or enhanced versions of our own world, it's equally important that software be able to interface with the <strong>physical world</strong>. After all, that's the world we live in, and so the information in the virtual world sometimes needs to be part of the physical world. For example, even devices as simple as printers have played a huge role of interleaving digital and physical workflows. Or, there may be new forms of computer output, such as the motions and behaviors of interactive robots. Research has spanned all of these use cases, going well beyond basic printing and force feedback to explore entirely new categories of feedback and fabrication. In this chapter, we'll discuss the history of basic physical output from computers, and then dive deep into the research innovations that are just beginning to reach the marketplace.</p>			

		<h2>1D output</h2>

		<p>In some sense, all output from computers is physical: the screens, holograms, and other light-based output from previous chapters are one class of output. The forms of output we discuss in this chapter just exploit matter instead of light.</p>
		
		<p>The first way that bits were translated into matter was through printing. The earliest printers...</p>

        * We introduce a bending mechanism that creates multiple, programmable shape-changing behaviors with inextensible materials, including paper, plastics and fabrics. We developed a software tool that generates these bending mechanism for a given geometry, simulates its transformation, and exports the compound geometry as digital fabrication files.

        * inexpensive fabrication method for creating Stretchis, highly stretchable user interfaces that combine sensing capabilities and visual output. We use Polydimethylsiloxan (PDMS) as the base material for a Stretchi and show how to embed stretchable touch and proximity sensors and stretchable electroluminescent displays.

        * GelTouch, a gel-based layer that can selectively transition between soft and stiff to provide tactile multi-touch feedback. It is flexible, transparent when not activated, and contains no mechanical, electromagnetic, or hydraulic components, resulting in a compact form factor (a 2mm thin touchscreen layer for our prototype). The activated areas can be morphed freely and continuously, without being limited to fixed, predefined shapes.  (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2807442.2807487">Miruchna et al. 2015</a>

        *  The key idea that allows the small and light impacto device to simulate a strong hit is that it decomposes the stimulus: it renders the tactile aspect of being hit by tapping the skin using a solenoid; it adds impact to the hit by thrusting the user's arm backwards using electrical muscle stimulation.

        * We introduce the tactile animation object, a directly manipulated phantom tactile sensation. This abstraction has two key benefits: 1) efficient, creative, iterative control of spatiotemporal sensations, and 2) the potential to support a variety of tactile grids, including sparse displays.

        * Foldios are foldable interactive objects with embedded input sensing and output capabilities. Foldios combine the advantages of folding for thin, lightweight and shape-changing objects with the strengths of thin-film printed electronics for embedded sensing and output. To enable designers and end-users to create highly custom interactive foldable objects, we contribute a new design and fabrication approach.

        * We introduce UltraHaptics, a system designed to provide multi-point haptic feedback above an interactive surface. UltraHaptics employs focused ultrasound to project discrete points of haptic feedback through the display and directly on to users' unadorned hands. We investigate the desirable properties of an acoustically transparent display and demonstrate that the system is capable of creating multiple localised points of feedback in mid-air. Through psychophysical experiments we show that feedback points with different tactile properties can be identified at smaller separations. We also show that users are able to distinguish between different vibration frequencies of non-contact points with training. Finally, we explore a number of exciting new interaction possibilities that UltraHaptics provides. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2501988.2502018">Carter et al. 2013</a>)
        
        * By varying the input waves, from 1 one to 4 actuators, it is possible to provide feelings of motion in any planar direction to a finger at one point on the screen while providing a different sensation, or none at all, to fingers placed at several other points on the screen. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2380296.2380300">Kaye 2012</a>)
        
        *  The proposed technology is based on the electrovibration principle, does not use any moving parts and provides a wide range of tactile feedback sensations to fingers moving across a touch surface. When combined with an interactive display and touch input, it enables the design of a wide variety of interfaces that allow the user to feel virtual elements through touch. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1866029.1866074">Bau et al. 2010</a>)

		* In this work, we utilize visuo-haptic illusions to improve the perceived performance of encountered-type haptic devices, specifically shape displays, in virtual reality. Shape displays are matrices of actuated pins that travel vertically to render physical shapes; however, they have limitations such as low resolution, small display size, and low pin speed. To address these limitations, we employ illusions such as redirection, scaling, and retargeting that take advantage of the visual dominance effect, the idea that vision often dominates when senses conflict. Our evaluation of these techniques suggests that redirecting sloped lines with angles less than 40 degrees onto a horizontal line is an effective technique for increasing the perceived resolution of the display. Scaling up the virtual object onto the shape display by a factor less than 1.8x can also increase the perceived resolution. Finally, using vertical redirection a perceived 3x speed increase can be achieved. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173724">Abtahi et al 2018</a>)

    * 3D printing
        * We introduce a new form of low-cost 3D printer to print interactive electromechanical objects with wound in place coils. At the heart of this printer is a mechanism for depositing wire within a five degree of freedom (5DOF) fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. Copper wire can be used with this mechanism to form coils which induce magnetic fields as a current is passed through them. Soft iron wire can additionally be used to form components with high magnetic permeability which are thus able to shape and direct these magnetic fields to where they are needed. When fabricated with structural plastic elements, this allows simple but complete custom electromagnetic devices to be 3D printed. As examples, we demonstrate the fabrication of a solenoid actuator for the arm of a Lucky Cat figurine, a 6-pole motor stepper stator, a reluctance motor rotor and a Ferrofluid display. In addition, we show how printed coils which generate small currents in response to user actions can be used as input sensors in interactive devices. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2984511.2984523">Peng et al. 2016</a>).

        * One powerful aspect of 3D printing is its ability to extend, repair, or more generally modify everyday objects. However, nearly all existing work implicitly assumes that whole objects are to be printed from scratch. Designing objects as extensions or enhancements of existing ones is a laborious process in most of today's 3D authoring tools. This paper presents a framework for 3D printing to augment existing objects that covers a wide range of attachment options (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2807442.2807498">Chen et al. 2015</a>)
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/obui6I2dzxk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        * Debugging 3D objects. In this paper, we propose a different approach: instead of re-printing the entire object from scratch, we suggest patching the existing object to reflect the next design iteration. We built a system on top of a 3D printer that accomplishes this: Users mount the existing object into the 3D printer, then load both the original and the modified 3D model into our software, which in turn calculates how to patch the object. After identifying which parts to remove and what to add, our system locates the existing object in the printer using the system's built-in 3D scanner. After calibrating the orientation, a mill first removes the outdated geometry, then a print head prints the new geometry in place. (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2807442.2807467">Teubrich et al. 2015</a>)

		* This paper considers the design, construction, and example use of a new type of 3D printer which fabricates three-dimensional objects from soft fibers (wool and wool blend yarn). This printer allows the substantial advantages of additive manufacturing techniques (including rapid turn-around prototyping of physical objects and support for high levels of customization and configuration) to be employed with a new class of material. This material is a form of loose felt formed when fibers from an incoming feed of yarn are entangled with the fibers in layers below it. The resulting objects recreate the geometric forms specified in the solid models which specify them, but are soft and flexible -- somewhat reminiscent in character to hand knitted materials.
